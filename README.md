# ðŸŽ§ Music RecSys with Metaflow

This repository contains code following the [Recommender Systems with Metaflow: Beginner](https://outerbounds.com/docs/recsys-tutorial-overview/) tutorial[^1].

> **Can we suggest what to listen to next when presented with a song?**
>
> Here I learn how to use DuckDB, Gensim, Metaflow, and Keras to build an end-to-end recommender system. The model learned from existing sequences (playlists by real users) how to continue extending an arbitrary new list. More generally, this task is also known as next event prediction (NEP). The modeling technique only leverage behavioral data in the form of interactions created by users when composing their playlists.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/outerbounds/metaflow-recsys).

[^1]: I've made some changes to the original tutorial to make it more readable, organized and/or robust.
